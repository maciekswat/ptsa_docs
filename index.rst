N-D labeled arrays and datasets in Python
=========================================

**xarray** (formerly **xray**) is an open source project and Python package
that aims to bring the labeled data power of pandas_ to the physical sciences,
by providing N-dimensional variants of the core pandas data structures.

Our goal is to provide a pandas-like and pandas-compatible toolkit for
analytics on multi-dimensional arrays, rather than the tabular data for which
pandas excels. Our approach adopts the `Common Data Model`_ for self-
describing scientific data in widespread use in the Earth sciences:
``xarray.Dataset`` is an in-memory representation of a netCDF file.

.. note::

   xray is now xarray! See :ref:`the v0.7.0 release notes<whats-new.0.7.0>`
   for more details. The preferred URL for these docs is now

xarray is an evolution of an internal tool developed at `The Climate
Corporation`__. It was originally written by Climate Corp researchers Stephan
Hoyer, Alex Kleeman and Eugene Brevdo and was released as open source in
May 2014. The project was renamed from "xray" in January 2016.
